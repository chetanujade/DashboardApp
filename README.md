React Dashboard

This is a React dashboard with sidebar and content. It is built using the following technologies:

React
React Router
Styled Components
To run the dashboard, you will need to have Node.js and NPM installed on your machine. Once you have installed Node.js and NPM, you can install the dependencies for the dashboard by running the following command:

npm install

Once the dependencies have been installed, you can start the development server by running the following command:

npm start

The development server will start on port 3000. You can open the dashboard in your browser by navigating to http://localhost:3000.

The dashboard is composed of the following components:

Header: The header contains the logo of the website or application, as well as the navigation bar.
Sidebar: The sidebar contains a list of links to the different pages of the website or application.
Content: The content is where the main content of the dashboard is displayed. This could include charts, tables, forms, and other types of content.
You can customize the dashboard to meet your specific needs by adding or removing components, and by changing the styling of the components. You can also use state management libraries such as Redux or Recoil to manage the state of the dashboard.
